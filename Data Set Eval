This data set was available very easily through the Dryad search function. Dryad is a nonprofit repository for medical and scientific data internationall which is compliant with FAIR principles. 
The search was very easy to navigate and find data that is recent and relevant to my area of study. These data are also assigned a unique identifier as a result of being uploaded to Dryad. This ensures the data are FAIR compliant. 
In the main text of the article, there is very robust metadata including collection methods, what data were collected, and definitions of the variables utilized in the tabulated data.
The data is stored in a reliable repository, Dryad, as stated above. Additionally, the data is presented in a csv file which is easily accessible and easily readable. 
The licensing is clearly stated on the Dryad page as  a public domain.
There are a few drawbacks to these data if it is being viewed by people without a medical background. The language used may be confusing if people are not familiar with the jargon and specifics used in veterinary medicine. For example, the significance of the use of lymph nodes ,ay not be clear to those who are unfamiliar with veterinary oncology research. Additionally, the use of the LN abbreviation may be confusing to some. Another medical aspect of the data that may not be clear to those unfamiliar with apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac (AGASACA) is the importance of hypercalcemia in the data set. Hypercalcemia is often associated with AGASACA due to the presence of parathyroid related protein (PTHrP) produced by the tumor. The other challenge to these data is the use of a numerical system to identify presence and absence of a specific characteristic like metastasis and surgical complications. This may cause some confusion with data analysis as some programs may be unable to convert these numbers to useful information. To make these data more readable, I would suggest including a list of abbreviations used within the data set itself. Additionally, it may be helpful to add columns to describe the data that was converted to a numerical value, so the data may be analyzed with either presentation.
